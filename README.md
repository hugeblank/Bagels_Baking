# Bagel's Baking

Bagel's Baking is the brain child of several members in my friend group coming together over a 
Minecraft [stream](https://twitch.tv/rrricohu) and thinking of various fun combinations of in-game 
food that should exist. I took it upon myself to start working on a few of the concepts put forward
in the discussion, and it snowballed into a team project.

I frequently stream making progress on this project on my [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/hugeblank), where
viewers earn points for watching, and can redeem for their username or a message as a comment in my code,
which is why the comments marked with "Redeemed" exist in the code.

Bagel's Baking aims to add an eccentric array of food items to the game while also staying close to vanilla 
behavior. Additionally it takes a crack at adding some seemingly missing items/features that really should
be there.

Features:
- Stews Stack to 16 per slot, instead of just 1
- Meat Burgers, Tacos, Pockets, and Sandwiches
- Expands on vanillas Cakes, Pies, and Stews
- Adds a beautiful translucent Halite & Polished Halite block, slabs, stairs, and walls
- Adds a mill block: Grind down various items like wheat or cocoa beans to get 
  crushed ingredients
- And more: Bagels, Jams, Meringue, Chicken Nuggets, Bacon, the list goes on!
