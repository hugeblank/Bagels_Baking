# Bagel's Baking

## Description
Bagel's Baking aims to add an eccentric array of food items to the game while also staying close to vanilla
behavior. Additionally it takes a crack at adding some seemingly missing items/features that really should
be there.

## Origin
Bagel's Baking is the brain child of several members in my friend group coming together over a 
Minecraft [stream](https://twitch.tv/rrricohu) and thinking of various fun combinations of in-game 
food that should exist. I took it upon myself to start working on a few of the concepts put forward
in the discussion, and it snowballed into a team project.

## Watch
I frequently stream making progress on this project on my [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/hugeblank), where
viewers earn points for watching, and can redeem for their username or a message as a comment in my code,
which is why the comments marked with "Redeemed" exist in the code.

Progress on the mod can be found on the [unstable](https://github.com/hugeblank/Bagels_Baking/tree/unstable) branch.
